# TRACcolors

A simple package to display TRAC standard colors and generate those colors in hex format for use in plotting.

## Quick Demo

Display a grid of TRAC colors and their associated color code with `colorgrid()`.

```{r}
library(TRACcolors)
colorgrid()
```

Referring to this plot, choose the color(s) of interest in the plotting package of your choice. Note in the example below that `tcolor("bl1")` is a string that is the associated color in hex format.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x=c("foo", "bar"), y=1:2), fill = tcolor("bl1")) +
  xlab("X Axis Title") + ylab("Y Axis Title")
```
